for me the unadulterated jewish religion is , like all other religions , an incarnation of primitive superstition . 
and the jewish people to whom i gladly belong , and in whose mentality i feel profoundly anchored , still for me does not have any different kind of dignity from all other peoples . 
as far as my experience goes , they are in fact no better than other human groups , even if they are protected from the worst excesses by a lack of power . 
otherwise i cannot perceive anything ' chosen ' about them .
