For me the unadulterated Jewish religion is , like all other religions , an incarnation of primitive superstition .
And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong , and in whose mentality I feel profoundly anchored , still for me does not have any different kind of dignity from all other peoples .
As far as my experience goes , they are in fact no better than other human groups , even if they are protected from the worst excesses by a lack of power .
Otherwise I cannot perceive anything ' chosen ' about them .
